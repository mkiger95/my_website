I am computer engineering student with a minor in math and computer science. I have 2 years of experience in developing, automation, data reconciliation, SQL databases, and more. Over the years I have led and delivered successful agile-structured projects. Highly effective at time management and interacting productively with colleagues and clients. Aspiring professional motivated to improve business processes and accelerate decision-making. I have done work ranging from data entry to coding automation scripts. I have also led projects and took leadership roles. After my first year of college I dove into the work force starting as a reservations agent at Bonotel Exclusive Travel. After sometime I asked to be moved to the IT department and became an IT intern. Later I was promoted to software developer. Since then I have helped with the internal support of staff, data entry, sat in big meetings with partners and provided feedback, coded scripts in python and javascript, extracted data from a database and compared with another database. Very familiar with agile methodologies and even more specifically, scrum.
