With a foundation in computer engineering and a minor in mathematics and computer science from UNLV, I've cultivated a versatile skill set since 2014. Beginning as an intern, I've navigated through various domains of technology, specializing in data scripting, automations, and microservices. I've also dabbled briefly in front-end development and enterprise website management.

My career journey led me to oversee FedRAMP CIS controls for an IBM service, where I ensured compliance and security standards. Managing 150 applications where I developed integrations and automations, employing a service account model for seamless administrative processes. Transitioning into cybersecurity, I've focused on vulnerability management, incident response, disaster recovery, application and network security, as well as logging and alerting systems. My commitment to maintaining FedRAMP controls underscores my dedication to secure and efficient operations.
