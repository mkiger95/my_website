Capable and adaptable college student with a focus on IT. Highly effective at time management and interacting productively with colleagues and clients. A quick learner and self-motivated to learn new technology and better problem solving skills.  After my first year of college I dove into the work force starting as a reservations agent at Bonotel Exclusive Travel. After sometime I asked to be moved to the IT department and became an IT intern. Later I was promoted to software developer. Since then I have helped with the internal support of staff, data entry, sat in big meetings with partners and provided feedback, coded minor scripts in python, extracted data from a database and compared with another database, and even lead minor projects and took leadership roles. Very familiar with agile methodologies and even more specifically, scrum.
